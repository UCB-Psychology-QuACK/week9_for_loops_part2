#### Practice ####

# 1) Write a for loop to print the numbers 1 through 10




# 2) Print the following pattern
# 1 
# 1 2 
# 1 2 3 
# 1 2 3 4 
# 1 2 3 4 5





# 3) Print the multiplication table for a given number (table should be 1 through 10)
# For example, let num = 2 to start
num <- 2




# 4) For a given number, calculate the sum of all the numbers between 1 and the given number. Print out the running total after you add the next number.
# Hint: How will you store the running sum?
num <- 15




# 5) Find the sum of the vector x.
x <- c(5, 15, 18, 19, 21, 23, 54)





# 6) Print the message "Done" after printing all the 
# The print call should be inside of the for loop!





# 7) CHALLENGE: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"
# Hint #1: Look up the modulus operator (%% in R, also referred to as mod)
# Hint #2: 4 %% 2 == 0, 5 %% 2 == 1, 6 %% 2 == 0, 7 %% 2 = 1




# From last week:
# Print the lyrics to the song "The Hokey Pokey"!
# Sample lyrics: 
# Put your left foot in
# You take your left foot out
# You put your left foot in
# And you shake it all about
# You do the hokey pokey
# And turn yourself around
# That's what it's all about!

# ... and right foot, and head, and left hand, and right hand, and tongue!
